This is a tutorial for beginners \nThis parkour is not an ordinary parkour, in which the world is divided into two dimensions: black and white. The dimension is determined by the color of the surrounding walls, and the computer can switch dimensions by pressing the E key. The relative positions in the two dimensions are unchanged before and after switching. \nTry switching dimensions now! ",
